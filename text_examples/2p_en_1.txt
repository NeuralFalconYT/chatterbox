Speaker 1: Hey, did you watch the new documentary on space travel?
Speaker 2: Not yet, but I heard it’s really fascinating. What did you think?
Speaker 1: Honestly, it blew my mind. The way they explained black holes was so clear.
Speaker 2: Oh, I’ve always been curious about that! Did they show animations too?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the visuals were stunning. It really made the concepts easier to understand.
Speaker 2: Now I definitely need to check it out this weekend.
